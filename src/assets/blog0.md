im not the biggest fan of writing long essays, and maybe as evidence of the lack of pre-planning before writing this, is me only just realising that these blog posts really don't have to be long, the chances that people will read this is small, obsurecly and passiontly people who may end up here. Yet im a driven by my looming asspiritation of having a carrer in the IT industry drives me to write.

Im thinking one of many obscure challengs that students face when transtionationg through university life, is such the the professinal exposure you provide yourself for potential employers, any regards on porfessinal persona,this took me sometime to realise, it is one that is discussed alot in university, but puttin it into practice is it's own mountain, this becomes more apperant when you few it industry specifacally, in IT specfially then are many side quests one can do to prepare for indunstry, and at the moment im focusing on adding to this a blog, a place where i share ideas and thoughts, stock standard get it off the list of side quests but it seems like you just got to give it a crack.

but more importantly getting cracked at computers comes next after making sweet blog posts, but i already did that, so i thought, everytime i learn a new digital skill im reminded the work that needs to be put into to learn a new topic, but common.knowedlge == constantly learning ? "DUh : "Wrong". but i think truly the constant quest we shoiuld all be on is constatly learning, this many words in im already a little confused what im saying, although catch me in person, and i would be more then happy to chat about the IT industry

Well hopefully over a few more blog posts, ill be able to write a little bit data on the big old world wide canvas that is the internet, which in itself has been one of the exciting things to learn about and woiuld be a great place to start if any.

Side Quests, Blog Posts, and the Never-Ending IT Grind

I’m not the biggest fan of writing long essays—and maybe as evidence of the lack of pre-planning before writing this, I’ve only just realised something: a blog post isnt suppose to be long. The chances that someone reads this are small. Maybe just a few obscure people and bots that trale the web somehow ending up here. And yet, here I am typing away anyway—because it is what everyone else does.

Im not really worried about doing what everyone else does, but i also dont really like doing things just to stand out as unique, instead i just do, what i enjoy. i think this mindset it was drives me in learning the specefic technologies i have chosen become adapt in.

Navigating the many roadmaps that exist for getting into the IT industry, many challenges will be faced along that journey. One of the lesser-talked-about (but very real) challenges students face while navigating university life is professional exposure. You know—actually putting yourself out there for potential employers. Everyone talks about building a professional persona at uni, but doing it in practice? Whole other mountain to climb.

This is especially true in the IT world. In this industry, there are so many “side quests” you can take to prepare yourself—Certs. GitHub repos. Labs. Projects. And now for me: this blog. A space to share ideas, thoughts, learnings—tick the ol’ “make a blog” box off the side quest list. But also, it just seemed worth giving a crack.

More importantly though, getting good at computers doesn’t stop at a sweet-looking blog. Every time I learn a new digital skill, I’m reminded just how much effort it takes to properly understand a new topic. And sure—everyone says “common knowledge: you’ve got to keep learning.”
But I think that’s wrong.
Learning isn’t just common sense. It’s something you have to chase—actively. That constant quest to level up is real, and honestly, it’s half the reason I enjoy this field.

That said, I’ve probably lost the plot a little by this point. But catch me in person, and I’d be more than happy to chat about all things IT—and all the weird and wonderful ways people grow into the industry.

Hopefully over the next few blog posts, I’ll be able to carve out a little bit of data on the big ol’ world wide canvas that is the internet. It’s been one of the most exciting things to learn about so far—and probably a good place to start for anyone wondering where to begin.
