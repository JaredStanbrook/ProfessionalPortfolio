## üöÄ Creating a New Feature

1. **Create a New Branch**

   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**

   - Add or update code in `src/` (frontend) or `worker/` (backend/API).
   - If you add a new page or API route, follow the existing folder structure.
   - Update or add tests if needed.

3. **Run Lint and Tests**

   ```bash
   bun run lint
   bun test
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**  
   Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for your commit messages:

   fix(api): correct error handling for login route
   ```

5. **Push and Open a Pull Request**

   ```
   - Go to GitHub and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.
   - Fill in the PR template and describe your changes clearly.

## üîÑ Keeping Your Branch Up to Date

To keep your feature branch up to date with the latest changes from `main`:

1. **Fetch the latest changes from upstream:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

2. **Switch to your local main branch and update it:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Rebase your feature branch onto the updated main:**

   ```bash
   git checkout feat/your-feature-name
   git rebase main
   ```

4. **If your branch has unrelated changes after a rebase, use cherry-pick to keep your PR focused:**
   - Create a new branch from `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name-clean
     ```
   - Cherry-pick only the relevant commits:
     ```bash
     git cherry-pick <commit-sha>
     ```
   - Push and open a new PR if needed.

- **Write clear commit messages:** Follow the Conventional Commits format.
- **Update documentation:** If your change affects usage, update the README or relevant docs.
